# Real attack for the Tor FSM thesis

The thesis (Bölüm 4.16 / S6) reports benign FPR from REAL Shadow logs but attacks were
SYNTHETIC injection. To make an attack real, a patched Tor binary must emit a genuine
protocol violation that the harness's log parser already detects.

## Harness log → event mapping (the key dependency)
The Shadow harness (`experiments/shadow_harness.mjs`, lives on the user's VM + GitHub
`mortemdulcem/tor-fsm-mdt`, NOT in the Replit workspace) parses Tor's **debug-level** log
lines of the form `function_name(): message`. Critical mappings:
- `circuit_send_first_onion_skin(): ...sending create cell` → **SEND_CREATE**
- `connection_ap_handshake_send_begin()` → **SEND_RELAY_DATA**
- `circuit_build_no_more_hops(): circuit built` → circuit built
- `circuit_finish_handshake()` → RECV_CREATED / (synthesized SEND_EXTEND + RECV_EXTENDED)

**Why this matters:** a real attack only needs the patched Tor to emit one of these log
lines out of FSM order. CREATE_FLOOD = the SEND_CREATE log appearing twice for one circuit.

## CREATE_FLOOD patch (verified compiles on VM Tor 0.4.6.10)
In `src/core/or/circuitbuild.c`, function `circuit_send_first_onion_skin`, after the first
`circuit_deliver_create_cell(...)` succeeds, deliver a SECOND duplicate CREATE cell gated by
`getenv("TOR_FSM_ATTACK_CREATE_FLOOD")`. This is a REAL duplicate cell on the wire, not a
fabricated log line (replit.md forbids plausible/fake methodology).
- `getenv` compiles clean: `circuitbuild.c` includes `or.h` → `lib/malloc/malloc.h` → `<stdlib.h>`, so no implicit-declaration under `-Werror`.
- Env-gating keeps ONE binary usable for both benign and attacker nodes (set env per-host in shadow.yaml).
- Patch saved at workspace `create_flood.patch` (apply with `patch -p1` inside tor-0.4.6.10).

## Build facts (VM = Ubuntu 22.04 / tez@tor-fsm-ubuntu)
- Vanilla AND patched Tor 0.4.6.10 compile cleanly with system libevent/openssl/zlib.
- Shadow at `~/.local/bin/shadow`; system tor `/usr/sbin/tor` v0.4.6.10 (apt, GCC 11.2 — NOT patchable).
- Source tarball: `https://dist.torproject.org/tor-0.4.6.10.tar.gz` (curl, wget exists on VM).

## Replit env limit
Shadow CANNOT run in the Replit sandbox (needs syscall interception / kernel caps) — this is
exactly why the thesis VM (Bölüm 4.15) exists. Patch + compile-verify can be done in Replit;
the Shadow RUN must happen on the VM.

## Remaining steps (multi-session)
1. Point ONE attacker host's process in the run's shadow.yaml at `~/tor-0.4.6.10/src/app/tor`
   with environment `TOR_FSM_ATTACK_CREATE_FLOOD=1`; benign hosts keep system tor.
2. Confirm the client's tor log shows TWO `sending create cell` lines for one circuit.
3. Disable the harness's SYNTHETIC create_flood injection; parse the real duplicate instead.
4. Update thesis: only CREATE_FLOOD becomes real; replay/bypass/premature stay synthetic.
   S6 honestly: "CREATE_FLOOD gerçek, diğerleri sentetik".

**Scope honesty:** this does NOT make all of S6 real — only one attack type.
